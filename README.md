# Source code for my personal academic site

## Zero frameworks

I'm tired of frameworks. Angular/React/Vue are obviously overkill for a small static website.
Static-site generators are nice but can be a pain to set up.

## Simplicity

For this website, I'm using a single dependency: `pandoc` (and a `Makefile`).
