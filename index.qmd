I'm Lukas, a postdoc in the LEADS group led by [Limor
Raviv](https://www.limorravivevolang.com) at the [Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics](https://mpi.nl).  I'm most passionate about natural language
processing and continual learning. Currently, I'm focusing on how deep
nets learn to communicate and how that relates to human language learning.

I did my PhD on text and graph representation learning with [Ansgar
Scherp](http://ansgarscherp.net) at [Kiel
University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/), where I also obtained my Master’s
degree in Computer Science. I've worked on text classification, information
retrieval, text representation learning, graph representation learning, and
lifelong (or continual) learning.

Besides research, I enjoy surfing, vanlife, and other sorts of outdoor
adventures. I like playing chess, doing yoga, and automatizing stuff (of course!).

## Current project 

Neural networks are still far behind human capabilities in generalizing from
few examples and continual learning. I want to fix that.

My current research investigates how neural network agents learn to
communicate. Imagine you put some (artificial, of course) neural network agents
into a game that can only be solved with communication. How do communication
protocols emerge?  How similar are those to emergent languages of humans in the
same setting? What can we learn from humans to improve our models?

This relates to the field of emergent communication. My first
baby-step into the field is a [workshop
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10590) that summarizes recent progress of the
emergent communication field and contrasts it with linguistic phenomena in
humans. I co-organized a [workshop on machine learning for language
evolution research](https://ml4evolang.github.io/) at the [Joint Conference for
Language
Evolution](https://sites.google.com/view/joint-conf-language-evolution/home).
