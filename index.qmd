I'm Lukas, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics](https://mpi.nl). I'm most passionate about natural language
processing and lifelong machine learning, while often engaging in
interdisciplinary projects. Currently, I'm focusing on how deep neural networks
learn to communicate and the parallels to human communication.
