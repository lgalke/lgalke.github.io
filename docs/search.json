    "text": "Lukas obtained his PhD in 2023 from Kiel University, specializing in Representation Learning for Texts and Graphs. Prior to that, he earned his MSc in Computer Science at the same institution in 2017. His research focuses on the intersection of lifelong machine learning and continuous or discrete communication in artificial neural networks. His work touches various areas, including natural language processing, graph representation learning, and information retrieval. Since 2022, Lukas has been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where he investigates the emergence of communication protocols between neural networks."
