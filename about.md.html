(#) about this website 

Whenever I need to look up something about myself, I look here first.  If I
don't find it, I add it. I use this website as a playground
for web technology and design (so expect relatively frequent changes).
This version of this website uses [MarkDeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/).
