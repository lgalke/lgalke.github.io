LLM-Paperstorm is a teaching activity for LLM-assisted paper reading, designed to help students engage with academic literature, while learning about responsible use of AI technology.

## Overview

The activity comprises having groups of students engage with research paper in their respective field through assistance of a large language model.
Students are instructed to validate the output of the LLM against the paper. In a subsequent syntehsis phase, students present their findings on the content level and on their experience of the language model's performance.
