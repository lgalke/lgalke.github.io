{"title":"Hi there!","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Hi there!"},"headingText":"Selected publications","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nI'm a postdoc in the LEADS group led by [Limor\nRaviv](https://www.limorravivevolang.com) at the [Max Planck Institute for\nPsycholinguistics](https://mpi.nl).  I'm most passionate about natural language\nprocessing and continual learning methods. Right now, I'm focusing on how deep\nnets learn to communicate and how that relates to human language learning.\n\nI did my PhD on text and graph representation learning with [Ansgar\nScherp](http://ansgarscherp.net) at [Kiel\nUniversity](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/), where I also obtained my Masterâ€™s\ndegree in Computer Science.  I've worked on text classification, information\nretrieval, self-supervised text representation learning, multimodal autoencoders,\nand lifelong graph learning.\n\nBesides research, I enjoy surfing, vanlife, and other sorts of outdoor\nadventures. I also like playing chess, doing yoga, and making music. I choose\nvim over emacs and actively prevent myself from spending more time with\nvimscript than the result would save me. \n\n\n- Galke & Scherp: [Bag-of-Words vs. Graph vs. Sequence in Text Classification: Questioning the Necessity of Text-Graphs and the Surprising Strength of a Wide MLP](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.279/), ACL 2022.\n- Vagliano, Galke, & Scherp: [Recommendations for item set completion: on the semantics of item co-occurrence with data sparsity, input size, and input modalities](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10791-022-09408-9), *Information Retrieval* 2022.\n- Galke, Franke, Zielke, & Scherp: [Lifelong learning of graph neural networks for open-world node classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9533412), IJCNN 2021.\n\nTo see more of my publications, visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=AHGGdYQAAAAJ&hl=en) or my [DBLP profile](https://dblp.org/pid/200/7830.html).\n\n## Current project \n\nNeural networks are still far behind human capabilities in generalizing from\nfew examples and continual learning. I want to fix that.\n\nMy current research investigates how neural network agents learn to\ncommunicate. Imagine you put some (artificial, of course) neural network agents\ninto a game that can only be solved with communication. How do communication\nprotocols emerge?  How similar are those to emergent languages of humans in the\nsame setting? What can we learn from humans to improve our models?\n\nThis relates very well to the field of emergent communication. My first\nbaby-step into the field is a [workshop\npaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10590) that summarizes recent progress of the\nemergent communication field and contrasts it with linguistic phenomena in\nhumans. Very recently, I co-organized a [workshop on machine learning for language\nevolution research](https://ml4evolang.github.io/) at the [Joint Conference for\nLanguage\nEvolution](https://sites.google.com/view/joint-conf-language-evolution/home).\n\n\n## Past projects\n\n- [Q-AKTIV - Quantitative Analysis of the Dynamics of the Scientific, Economic, and Social Impact of Research Activities and Networks](https://q-aktiv.github.io)\n- [Linked Open Citation Database](https://locdb.bib.uni-mannheim.de/blog/en/)\n\n## Contact\n\nI'm usually open to collaborate as long as it's mildly related to what I'm\ndoing.
