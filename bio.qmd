## Formal bio

Lukas Galke was born in Wuppertal, Germany in 1989.  He received the B.Sc. and
M.Sc. degrees in computer science from Kiel University, Germany, in 2017 and
the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the same university in 2023. 

From 2017 to 2021, he was a Doctoral Researcher with Kiel University and with
ZBW -- Leibniz Information Centre for Economics.  Since 2022, he has been a
Postdoctoral Researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics,
Nijmegen, Netherlands.  He is the author of more than 20 journal articles,
conference proceedings papers, and workshop papers.  His research interests
include natural language processing, graph representation learning, and
lifelong machine learning.

## Less formal bio (100 words)

Lukas obtained his PhD in 2023 from Kiel University, specializing in
Representation Learning for Texts and Graphs. Prior to that, he earned his MSc
in Computer Science at the same institution in 2017. His research focuses on
the intersection of lifelong machine learning and continuous or discrete
communication in deep neural networks. His work touches various areas,
including natural language processing, graph representation learning, and
information retrieval. Since 2022, Lukas has been working as a postdoctoral
researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where he
investigates the emergence of communication protocols between neural networks.
