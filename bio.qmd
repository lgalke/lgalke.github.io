Lukas obtained his PhD in 2023 from Kiel University, specializing in
Representation Learning for Texts and Graphs. Prior to that, he earned his MSc
in Computer Science at the same institution in 2017. His research focuses on
the intersection of lifelong machine learning and continuous or discrete
communication in artificial neural networks. His work touches various areas,
including natural language processing, graph representation learning, and
information retrieval. Since 2022, Lukas has been working as a postdoctoral
researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where he
investigates the emergence of discrete communication protocols among neural
network agents.
